# **Generalization**

1. Generalization is like a bottom-up approach in which two or more entities of lower level combine to form a higher level entity if they have some attributes in common.

2. In generalization, an entity of a higher level can also combine with the entities of the lower level to form a further higher level entity.

3. Generalization is more like subclass and superclass system, but the only difference is the approach. Generalization uses the bottom-up approach.

4. In generalization, entities are combined to form a more generalized entity, i.e., subclasses are combined to make a superclass.

For example, Faculty and Student entities can be generalized and create a higher level entity Person.
